This is the homework assignment for Unit 01 HTML, CSS and Git

## What problem are we trying to solve
This project was created to code refactor code that was deemed unwieldly in it's current state and needed to be cleaned up for future sustained use. 

## Requirements
- div elements will be replaced with semantic HTML elements where proper
- HTML elements will follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image elements will contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes on the page will fall in sequential order
- Title element is concise and descriptive

## Notes
I believe that most of the refactoring in this codebase is up to snuff. All of the div elements have been replaced by proper semantic elements. I also believe that I was able to cut down on the need for so many different class and id's for elements. While I believe I eliminated most of redundant code in the style.css, there may be some that I missed and I will continue to improve upon in the future.
